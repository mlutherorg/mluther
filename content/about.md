**Our Pastor and His Wife**

Dr. James Witt has served as the pastor Martin Luther since 1986.  Pastor Witt has a loving concern for people and their needs and also a strong commitment to sharing the truth of the biblical Christian faith. A scholar and author, Dr. Witt has written on numerous theological and ministry subjects.  As part of his service to the Lord and His Church, Pastor Witt serves as an administrator and professor for a Lutheran mission organization that trains Christian leaders in Christian doctrine and ministry skills to bring the Gospel to people in mainland China.

Pastor Witt’s wife, Peggy, is active partner in ministry.    She directs the children’s choirs and plays organ at church.   She is an adjunct professor of early childhood education for Martin Luther College in New Ulm, Minnesota.   Peggy also teaches evangelistic Bible studies to new believers and seekers in China. 

The Witts' have four adult children and three grandchildren, who all love their Savior and the St. Louis Cardinals.

**Our Beliefs**

Martin Luther is firmly committed to the historic, Christian faith and the key principles that:

1. The Bible is entirely the true Word of God and is the only reliable source for our religious beliefs.
2. All people are sinful and can do nothing to save themselves.   We are saved only because of God’s undeserved love for us and through faith in Jesus Christ, who lived a holy life in our place and died to pay the penalty for all our sins. 
3. Our good works are a necessary fruit and evidence of saving faith in Jesus.  They are not in any way a payment for our salvation.   They are a “thank you” to God for already saving us.

**Martin Luther Evangelical Lutheran Church**

Martin Luther Evangelical Lutheran Church was found in 1967 by Christian people who wanted a congregation that would faithfully follow the teachings of God’s Word and share God’s truth with the people of the Saint Louis area. Today, Martin Luther serves people who live in all parts of Saint Louis County and in St. Louis City.  Martin Luther also has a satellite location (Christ Our Savior) located at 2012 Vandalia Street in Collinsville, Illinois. 

Martin Luther is a member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, a church body that has a passion for following and sharing the life-giving teachings of the Bible faithfully in order to meet the spiritual needs of people for life now and for eternity.
